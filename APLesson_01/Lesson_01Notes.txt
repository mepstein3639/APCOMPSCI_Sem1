Lesson 01 Notes

Today in class I learned how to use the print statement.
It goes like this:

public class SecondProgram

{
	public static void main(String[]args)
	{
		System.out.println("");	
	}
}

This format allows for the print of anything. With this we printed out ascii art in which we coppied every single 
line in order to create a picture.
