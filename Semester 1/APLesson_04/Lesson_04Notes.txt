Lesson_04 Notes

This time around we learned how to call method and objects to print statments 
from one line. 

This is useful in order to continue running the code and and printing it without
having to type it out many times.

The basic format is:

import java.util.Scanner;

public class ________
{
	public static void main(String[]args)
	{
	_________ form = new ________-();
		
		Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);
	
	}

	public void format(String word1, String word2)
	
	{
		System.out.printf("* %15s %20s *\n", word1,word2);
	}
		
This format allows for strings and doubles to be printed in a certain formating that
is also appealing to the user.

It makes it possible to personalize the print staments a little more than before.
