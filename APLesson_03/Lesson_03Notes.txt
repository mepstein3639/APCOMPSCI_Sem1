Lesson_03 Notes

Today I learned how to use different commands to create variables and add them into texts. 
You need to start with 

import java.util.Scanner; 

and then you must create a new scanner 

Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);

and then a string with variable such as

String name = keyboard.next();

After tinkering with these new codes I created a BMI calclater and used float for that.
I then finished off with created a conversion between dollars to euoroes with some double statements.
